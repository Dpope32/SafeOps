Wally,

To get the app on your phone -

1. Connect USB drive to phone
2. Open USB notification, tap clark.apk
3. It should prompt your settings to open > Allow unknown app installation
4. Select "Files" app, enable installation
5. It should automatically begin downloading, if not click the apk file again.

If you need help, I'm always around!

I didn't do that extensive of testing so if you find any weird behavior let me know and I'll get you an update apk link.

Merry Christmas,
